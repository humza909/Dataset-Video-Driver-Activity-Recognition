# UET Driver Activity Recognition Dataset

This dataset is used in the paper: [Driver activity recognition by learning spatiotemporal features of pose and human object interaction](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1047320321000808)

It contains 103 video recordings taken in daylight conditions, comprising 10 actors, mimicking 11 different activities while
